User Administration
Your name is Jane. Create a repository for your project named “Linux”. The folder is created outside the
home directory of Jane.
It is a group project and your friend Tom also has to have access to this repository.
Things to be noted:
• You create a user Tom with short description and password and a home directory.
• Let Tom modify his shell and password.
• Tom shouldn’t be able to access your home folder.
• Create another folder named ‘notes’ where you keep your study notes and Tom and may be
other friends can also have same access to it. Guest shouldn’t be able to modify anything.
• Create another folder named ‘research’ where you keep the list of your researches. Others can
have a look at list of researches in it but no one should be able to read, write it.
